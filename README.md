##About

Navali is a plugin to interact with the Prophecies NPC Navali. It goes to Navali, seeks new prophecies and seals prophecies you specify.

To specify which prophecies to seal, simply check the checkbox in the settings dialog. To find more information about the prophecies check the poe wiki.




##Installation

Put the .zip file in your 3rdParty folder

##Requirements

- EXtensions (comes bundled with EB)
- CommunityLib

Both plugins need to be enabled in the settings (duh).

How what where why?

When the character enters a town or hideout, it checks for Navali. If it's there it will talk to Navali and seek prophecies. After seeking Prophecies it will check for Prophecies to seal and seal those you selected. It will then continue with it's normal operation (Mapping, Grinding, whatever) until the bot enters town again.
